#  Diwali Sales Analysis 

## Overview

The Diwali Sales Analysis project aims to analyze sales trends during the Diwali festival using data analytics techniques. 
The project utilizes Python-based data processing and visualization to uncover key insights related to customer demographics,
product categories, and purchasing behaviors.

## Dataset

- File: Diwali Sales Data.csv
- Description: The dataset contains sales transaction data, including customer demographics, purchase details, and product categories.
- Key Columns:
    - Customer ID
    - Gender
    - Age Group
    - State
    - Product Category
    - Amount
    - Purchase Date

## Analysis Approach

The Jupyter Notebook (Diwali_Sales_Analysis.ipynb) includes the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Loading the dataset
   - Handling missing values and data cleaning
   - Data type conversions
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Summary statistics
   - Distribution of sales across demographics (gender, age group, state, etc.)
   - Top-performing product categories
3. Data Visualization:
   - Bar charts, pie charts, and histograms for sales distribution
   - Line charts for sales trends
   - Heatmaps for correlation analysis

## Technologies Used 

1. Programming Language: Python

2. Libraries:
   - Pandas (for data manipulation)
   - Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
   - NumPy (for numerical computations) 

## How to Run the Project

1. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Diwali_Sales_Analysis.ipynb

3. Execute the cells sequentially to perform the analysis.

## Insights Gained
